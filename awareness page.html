        <h2 style="color: white;font-style: oblique;font-size: 35px;">Common Threats and How to Respond:</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><strong>1. Street Harassment (Catcalling or Following):</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;color: white;"><strong>How to Respond</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Stay Calm and Alert:</strong> Don’t engage with the harasser unless absolutely necessary. Walk with purpose and confidence.</li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Change Your Route:</strong> If you feel uncomfortable, cross the street, or change your path toward well-lit, populated areas.</li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Phone a Friend:</strong> Call someone or act like you’re talking to someone on the phone. This can make the harasser lose interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><strong>2. Choking or Being Pinned:</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;color: white;"><strong>How to Respond</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Escape Technique:</strong>Raise your arms and bring them down in a sharp motion between the attacker’s arms while turning your body sideways.  </li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Stay Calm and Breathe:</strong> It’s crucial to remain as calm as possible to conserve energy and think clearly.</li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Protect Yourself on the Ground: </strong>If pinned, use your hips and legs to push the attacker off balance while targeting vulnerable spots <strong>(like the groin or face)</strong> to make your escape.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><strong>3. Bear Hug from Behind:</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;color: white;"><strong>How to Respond</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Strike Backwards:</strong> Use the back of your head to hit the attacker’s face or stomp hard on their feet.</li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Elbow Strike:</strong>If your arms are free, use an elbow to strike the attacker's ribs or face. If your arms are restrained, you can  try breaking their hold by loosening their grip by twisting your body. </li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Lower Your Center of Gravity:</strong>Bend your knees slightly to make yourself harder to lift.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;color: white;"><strong>4. Sexual Assault (Close Proximity Attack):</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;color: white;"><strong>How to Respond</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Defensive Moves:</strong> Aim for sensitive areas like the eyes, nose, throat, or groin with quick, forceful strikes. </li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Use Objects Around You:</strong> If available, use items like a purse, phone, or umbrella as a weapon to fend off the attacker.</li><br>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;color: white;"><strong>Make a Scene: </strong> Scream, shout, and draw attention. Attackers rely on fear and silence, so loud noises may deter them and attract help.</li>
        </ul><br>

                    at its root—by prohibiting the rampant sale of acid in the market. Her efforts have gone a long way in drawing stricter laws in the country on the sale and availability of acid, as well as in supporting 
                    thousands of acid attack survivors across the nation.Today, Laxmi is a beacon of inspiration for everyone. 
                    Like her, several other acid attack survivors did not let the ordeal define the trajectory of their lives and have gone on to achieve exemplary heights in professional or personal domains.</i>

                    It started as verbal abuse in 2015,until one evening he shot her on her back with a gun.He shot her and said <strong>"Look what you made me do!!".</strong>
                    She spent 3 weeks in hospital. During that time around 400 people came to visit her. That’s when she realized she had a message she wanted to share.
                    I survived nine gunshots, but I’ve never cried about being paralyzed. I still have pity parties, but it’s because I have to rely on others, when all I want is to be a mother again. This year, I will be partnering with the IRIS domestic violence centre,
                    where I will be talking to people about what to do if you’re experiencing an abusive relationship.</i>
